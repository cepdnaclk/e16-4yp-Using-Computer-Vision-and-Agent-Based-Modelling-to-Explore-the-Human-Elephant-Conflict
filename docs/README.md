## Project Summary

Human-Elephant conflict has caused damage to the
well-being of life for many decades. The methods taken to avoid
and mitigate these harmful interactions have not provided safe
outcomes as expected. So the requirement of a long-term solution
for these conflicts arises to reduce the impacts. We propose
a method using computer vision and Agent-based Modelling
(ABM) techniques together, to provide a set of optimal long-
term policies to reduce the impacts significantly for conflict-
bound regions. The initial stage of this work focuses on creating
a segmented image from a given satellite/aerial image with
different classes such as water, buildings, croplands, etc to
represent the area of impact. Then in the second stage, these
images should be converted to an ABM-friendly format. At
the final stage, they can be used to simulate the real-world
environment with the related agents using a suitable Agent-based
model. This method is capable of providing policies with optimal
parameters for population counts, and safe distances to human
regions from elephant habitats for notable reductions in conflicts.
The real environment is simulated through ABM frameworks
and human-elephant behavioral patterns are provided to create
heterogeneous agents with stochastic movements. The identified
best-case policies for a region can aid the decision-makers of
the governments, and wildlife authorities to move forward with
safe construction planning and conservation of elephant habitats.
Ultimately, the use of this prediction and simulation model will
provide recommended strategies to improve the survival rate by
reducing human-elephant conflicts in many regions of the world.

We believe this research expands the scope that can be
explored with the use of combining computer vision with
agent-based modelling for solving interaction-based problems
that is a threat to the world with simulated environments.
Further research and improvements with this existing model
will generate more substantial results that would solve world
crises with the use of modern technology capabilities for a
better future.
