# Using Computer Vision and Agent-Based Modelling to explore the Human-Elephant conflict
___

Human-Elephant conflict is one of the major identifiable problems in Sri Lanka. As a result of deforestation and urbanisation, elephants are being squeezed into smaller and smaller areas. Due to this matter, conflicts between humans and elephants are increasing daily. This is a threat to both human lives and to the conservation of the wild elephants. Several traditional strategies have been imposed to prevent this since the early days but they do not seem to reduce the conflict. Because these traditional strategies do not consider elephant habitats and their behaviours. 

The aim of this project is to use Artificial Intelligence computer-based technologies to prevent human-elephant conflicts by giving necessary warnings.
